🖥️ Assets IT Dashboard | Power BI Project

This project is an Assets IT Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI, designed to help businesses track, monitor, and manage IT asset utilization and lifecycle status efficiently. 💼💡

✨ The dashboard provides a clear visual overview of key asset metrics, including:

Total Assets

Used Assets

Destroyed Assets

Total Asset Value (Pricing)

It enables users to instantly understand how many assets are actively in use, which ones are no longer operational, and the total financial value associated with each category.

📊 A bar and card visual combination presents the breakdown of asset statuses, making it easy to identify resource allocation and potential replacements needed.

🗺️ A location filter allows users to view asset distribution by branch or site—giving clear visibility into where assets are concentrated and helping with regional asset planning.

💰 A pricing insight section highlights the total and average value per asset, helping finance and IT teams evaluate capital efficiency and replacement cost planning.

🔍 With interactive filters and dynamic visuals, users can explore the data by location, status, or asset type for more focused and actionable insights.

💡 This project demonstrates how Power BI can turn asset management data into meaningful business intelligence—helping teams maintain transparency, optimize costs, and make smarter IT investment decisions.
